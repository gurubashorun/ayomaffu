            Far from the scepticism and misinformation that dominated the
            conversation a year ago, ordinary Australians are now talking to
            each other about crypto. We explored our trading data to understand
            how the cryptocurrency market performed in 2021, gaining insights
            into the attitudes and behaviours of crypto investors.

            The Investor Study Report published in April 2022, uses data that
            has been captured from the BTC Markets platform throughout the
            calendar year for 2021. It provides an overview of market
            performance and an in-depth exploration of data related to user
            behaviour and investor confidence.

            BTC Markets ran a survey in FY20-21 with over 1,800 participants
            from Australia to find out what the average Australian
            cryptocurrency investor looks like. We found Australian investors
            are as diverse in their motivations and reasons for investing as
            their counterparts in traditional markets.
